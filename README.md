Introduction
This repository is designed for those who want to get hands-on experience with basic machine learning projects. The projects included here will help you understand and apply various machine learning algorithms on real-world datasets.
Datasets
Wine Quality Dataset
Source: Kaggle Wine Quality Dataset
Description: This dataset contains information about different types of red and white wine, including their chemical properties and quality ratings.
Iris Flower Dataset
Source: UCI Machine Learning Repository Iris Dataset
Description: This classic dataset includes measurements of sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width for three species of iris flowers.
Titanic Survival Dataset
Source: Kaggle Titanic Dataset
Description: This dataset contains information about the passengers on the Titanic, including whether they survived or not.
Projects
Wine Quality Prediction
Goal: Predict the quality of wine based on its chemical properties using regression algorithms.
Techniques: Data preprocessing, feature selection, model training and evaluation.
Iris Flower Classification
Goal: Classify iris flowers into their respective species using classification algorithms.
Techniques: Data visualization, model training, and evaluation.
Titanic Survival Prediction
Goal: Predict whether a passenger survived or not based on their characteristics using classification algorithms.
Techniques: Data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training and evaluation.
