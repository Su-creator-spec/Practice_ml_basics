## Introduction

This repository is designed for those who want to get hands-on experience with basic machine learning projects. The projects included here will help you understand and apply various machine learning algorithms on real-world datasets.

## Datasets

1. **Wine Quality Dataset**
   - Source: [Kaggle Wine Quality Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/red-wine-quality-cortez-et-al-2009)
   - Description: This dataset contains information about different types of red and white wine, including their chemical properties and quality ratings.

2. **Iris Flower Dataset**
   - Source: [UCI Machine Learning Repository Iris Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/iris)
   - Description: This classic dataset includes measurements of sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width for three species of iris flowers.

3. **Titanic Survival Dataset**
   - Source: [Kaggle Titanic Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic)
   - Description: This dataset contains information about the passengers on the Titanic, including whether they survived or not.

## Projects

1. **Wine Quality Prediction**
   - Goal: Predict the quality of wine based on its chemical properties using regression algorithms.
   - Techniques: Data preprocessing, feature selection, model training and evaluation.

2. **Iris Flower Classification**
   - Goal: Classify iris flowers into their respective species using classification algorithms.
   - Techniques: Data visualization, model training, and evaluation.

3. **Titanic Survival Prediction**
   - Goal: Predict whether a passenger survived or not based on their characteristics using classification algorithms.
   - Techniques: Data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training and evaluation.
